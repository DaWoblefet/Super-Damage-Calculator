The Super Damage Calculator is a damage calculator written by Leonard Craft III (DaWoblefet). It features more flexible team support with the Team Toggle feature and follows the current Generation VII research on damage modifier order. It is currently in development.

To use the Super Damage Calculator, first [install Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/). Then, download the .jar file in [releases](https://github.com/DaWoblefet/Super-Damage-Calculator/releases). This project is still early in production, so I expect there to be several bugs/things not working right; please be patient as I iron things out. Shoot me a message or make a formal [issue](https://github.com/DaWoblefet/Super-Damage-Calculator/issues) if you find a bug.
